# junkyaRd

## Usage
The package _junkyaRd_ essentially is a dump of random functions. At the moment it contains three functions that I created for an assignment in my course. But it essentially aims to be a random spot to dump functions in. 

## Functions

#### remind_me()

This function contains no arguments; by simply running it, a list of things you need to remmeber pops up. In particular, the remind_me() function gives you a list of things you may need to remember or is like a handy list for a reunion with old friends, or just a small sleepover/trip/gathering with friends & family. 

This is all you do and see what it produces! ;)

```eval = TRUE
remind_me()
```


#### cheat()

This function contains only one argument: `question_number`. You must insert a question number from Assignment 3.1 (for e.g. you simply type 1 or 14 or 7). The function then returns the solution to that question. This is how you would use it: 

```eval = TRUE
cheat(1)      # to get the solution for Q3.1.1
cheat(7)      # to get the solution for Q3.1.7
```

_Note: The cheat() function only works for specific questions at the moment - specifically: _


#### make_art()

This function generates random art. It has the following arguments:
